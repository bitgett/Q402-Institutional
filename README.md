## Why

On every EVM chain, users need to hold a native gas token (BNB, ETH, AVAX, OKB, MNT, INJ, USDT0) just to move USDC/USDT. A user holding $100 of USDC on BNB Chain cannot transfer anything without first acquiring BNB — that's where Web3 onboarding collapses. Q402 removes that step entirely: the sender signs an EIP-712 authorization off-chain, Q402's relayer submits the on-chain transaction and pays the gas, and the recipient receives 100% of the stablecoin.

The same primitive serves AI agents. Managing gas across multiple chains for many autonomous agents is operationally painful; one Q402 account covers all of them through a single API key.

---

## What it does

```
User signs EIP-712 off-chain
  → Q402 relayer submits Type 4 (EIP-7702) transaction
    → on-chain: USDC/USDT/RLUSD moves from sender to recipient
      → recipient receives 100%, sender pays $0
```

All eight chains share the same witness type, the same signing rule (`verifyingContract = user EOA`), and the same on-wire body shape. The chain-specific parts are the deployed implementation contract and the EIP-712 domain name.

## Supported chains

| Chain | Chain ID | Tokens | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| BNB Chain | 56 | USDC, USDT | live |
| Ethereum Mainnet | 1 | USDC, USDT, RLUSD | live |
| Avalanche C-Chain | 43114 | USDC, USDT | live |
| X Layer | 196 | USDC, USDT | live |
| Stable Chain | 988 | USDT0 (aliased to USDC/USDT) | live |
| Mantle | 5000 | USDC, USDT (USDT0) | live |
| Injective EVM | 1776 | USDT | live |
| Monad | 143 | USDC, USDT (USDT0) | live |
| Scroll | 534352 | USDC, USDT | live |

RLUSD (Ripple USD, NY DFS regulated, 18 decimals) is Ethereum-only by issuer design. Native USDC on Injective EVM is announced for Q2 2026 via Circle CCTP and will be added when it ships.

## Three ways to use Q402

### 1. End user — the dashboard

Sign up at [q402.quackai.ai](https://q402.quackai.ai) with Google, email, or a wallet. The dashboard surfaces your live + sandbox API keys, transaction history, gas-tank balances, and (during the BNB-focus event) the free-trial credit gauge.

### 2. Web developer — the browser SDK

Drop the public SDK in any page that already has `window.ethereum`:

```html
<script src="https://q402.quackai.ai/q402-sdk.js"></script>
<script>
  const q402 = new Q402Client({ apiKey: "q402_live_…", chain: "bnb" });
  await q402.pay({ to: recipientAddress, amount: "10.00", token: "USDT" });
</script>
```

The SDK handles the EIP-712 signature, the EIP-7702 authorization, and the POST to `/api/relay`. The user signs once in their wallet; the recipient receives the full amount.

### 3. AI agent — the MCP server

```bash
npx -y @quackai/q402-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop / Claude Code config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "q402": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@quackai/q402-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "Q402_TRIAL_API_KEY": "q402_live_…",
        "Q402_MULTICHAIN_API_KEY": "q402_live_…",
        "Q402_PRIVATE_KEY": "0x…",
        "Q402_ENABLE_REAL_PAYMENTS": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Set whichever applies — both is best. The server auto-routes by chain: `chain="bnb"` + Q402_TRIAL_API_KEY set → Trial (free 2k TX sponsored, same rule for `q402_pay` and `q402_batch_pay` up to 5 recipients); anything else → Multichain. **Ambiguity gate:** 6+ recipient BNB batches return `status="ambiguous"` instead of executing so the agent can ask the user to pick `keyScope="trial"` (first 5), `"multichain"` (all paid), or two calls (5 free + remainder paid). Set `keyScope` on a tool call to force one explicitly. Single-env setups (only `Q402_API_KEY` set) keep working unchanged — that env var stays supported as a legacy fallback.

The agent can now `q402_quote` (compare gas across all 9 chains), `q402_balance` (verify key + remaining credits), `q402_pay` (single-recipient gasless transfer), `q402_batch_pay` (one signed batch to up to 20 recipients on a single chain × token), and `q402_receipt` (fetch + cryptographically verify a Trust Receipt). Sandbox mode is the default — only the simultaneous presence of all three live-mode env vars switches `q402_pay` and `q402_batch_pay` into real on-chain settlement.

## Free trial event

Any developer can sign up at [/event](https://q402.quackai.ai/event) and immediately receive:

- 2,000 sponsored transactions on BNB Chain
- Both a live (`q402_live_*`) and a sandbox (`q402_test_*`) API key
- 30-day window from the moment of signup

Trial credits are real settlements — the relayer's hot wallet pays the gas, the recipient receives the full amount, and the trial counter atomically decrements on every transfer. Trial credentials live in their own key slot (`trialApiKey` / `trialSandboxApiKey`) so they keep working until the trial window or credits are exhausted; upgrading on [/payment](https://q402.quackai.ai/payment) provisions a separate paid key (`apiKey` / `sandboxApiKey`) drawn against a self-funded Gas Tank.

The trial is BNB-Chain-only by server-side policy (`TRIAL_BNB_ONLY` gate). Paid keys see the full 9-chain matrix.

## Authentication model

- **API key** identifies the caller; rate-limited per key and per IP. Live keys (`q402_live_*`) and sandbox keys (`q402_test_*`) live side-by-side on every account — sandbox returns mock results without touching the chain.
- **EIP-712 witness** (`TransferAuthorization`) proves the user authorized this specific transfer (owner / facilitator / token / recipient / amount / nonce / deadline).
- **EIP-7702 authorization** delegates the user's EOA to execute the Q402 implementation contract for this one tx. Signed with `wallet.authorize(...)` (ethers v6.16+) which produces the protocol-correct `keccak256(0x05 || rlp([chainId, address, nonce]))` signature.
- **Wallet binding** (optional, for email users) links a wallet to an email account 1:1 via a signed challenge. See the bind-once contract documented in `app/api/auth/wallet-bind/route.ts`.

---

## Tech stack

- Next.js 16.2 + React 19 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS, framer-motion
- ethers.js v6.16+ (EIP-7702 native via `Wallet.authorize`)
- Vercel KV (Upstash Redis) for KV-backed state
- viem on the relayer side for `sendTransaction({ authorizationList })`
- Hardened build: `next build --webpack` (Turbopack build has been observed to PageNotFoundError some API routes on Next 16.2)

## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitgett/Q402-Institutional.git
cd Q402-Institutional
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in the values you actually have
npm run dev                  # → http://localhost:3000
```

Required env vars (the rest are optional / Vercel-managed):

| Var | What |
|---|---|
| `RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY` | Hot wallet that submits relays + pays gas |
| `KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` | Vercel KV |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth client (same value) |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_ADDRESS` | Email magic-link sender |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Shared header that authorizes Vercel cron POSTs |

`.env.example` carries the complete list with comments. Never commit `.env.local` / `.env.preview` — `.gitignore` excludes the broad `.env*` glob.

---

## Tests

```bash
npm test               # vitest — source + behavior + drift guards
npx eslint . --max-warnings=0
npx next build --webpack
npm audit --omit=dev
```

Test files cover relay route ordering, EIP-7702 signing shape, trial-vs-paid key scope isolation, gas-deposit dedup invariants, identity-model state machine, and several drift guards (`contracts.manifest.json` ↔ relayer, MCP package ↔ landing SDK).

---

## Security highlights

- **Replay**: every settled tx hash is sealed in KV with `used_txhash:{hash}` (10y TTL). Same on-chain tx cannot be used to activate a subscription twice.
- **Authorization lock**: relay route pins `authorization.chainId` and `authorization.address` to `contracts.manifest.json` at request time — a client cannot smuggle a different impl contract.
- **Trial scope**: enforced by `keyRecord.plan`, not by the subscription's current plan. A paid user holding a legacy trial key still sees trial-scope policy (BNB only, trial expiry) on that key.
- **Identity 1:1**: wallet ↔ email is enforced bidirectionally via `wallet_email_link` + `email_to_wallet` indexes. Cross-session attempts to claim either side return `409`.
- **EIP-7702 spec**: authorization signatures use ethers' native `Wallet.authorize()` — protocol-correct RLP+keccak, validated by EVM ecrecover; no EIP-712 fallback.

---

## Roadmap

- **Multi-agent infrastructure**: one Q402 account, many delegated agent identities sharing a single Gas Tank. Each agent gets its own wallet, scoped spending policy, and isolated activity log. *(In planning.)*
- **Account merge**: pseudo-account ↔ wallet principal migration job. Today's read-side bridge keeps the UX clean; the migration physically consolidates the records.
- **Wallet recovery**: OTP-gated re-pair endpoint for lost-wallet cases. Today's flow is support-only.
